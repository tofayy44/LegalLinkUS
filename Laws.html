  <h2>Know Your Rights</h2>

  <h3>For Undocumented Immigrants (Illegals):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>You have the right to remain silent.</strong> You are not obligated to speak to ICE agents or police about your immigration status, where you were born, or how you entered the U.S.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not open the door.</strong> If ICE comes to your home, ask for a signed warrant through a window or mail slot. A valid warrant must be signed by a judge — NOT just ICE paperwork.</li>
    <li><strong>Carry a Know Your Rights card.</strong> You can carry a card that states your right to remain silent and request a lawyer. This helps you avoid speaking under pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Stay calm during a stop.</strong> If you are pulled over or approached in public, stay still, don’t run, and calmly ask if you’re free to leave. If not, ask for legal representation.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not lie or provide false documents.</strong> It can make your situation worse and lead to criminal charges. Stay silent and demand a lawyer.</li>
    <li><strong>You have the right to an attorney.</strong> While not guaranteed at government expense in immigration court, you can hire one or request resources for free legal clinics.</li>
    <li><strong>Do not sign anything you don’t understand.</strong> ICE may try to get you to sign a "voluntary departure" — this can result in being banned from reentry. Always ask for a lawyer first.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For Trappers (Hustlers):</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>4th Amendment Protection:</strong> Law enforcement cannot legally search you, your vehicle, or your home without a warrant, consent, or probable cause.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t talk business on the phone.</strong> Always assume you're being listened to. Anything you say can be used in a case against you later.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask for a lawyer immediately upon arrest.</strong> Don’t answer any questions, even if you think it’s harmless.</li>
    <li><strong>Don’t consent to any search.</strong> Verbally say, “I do not consent to a search.” It might help your case later if evidence was taken illegally.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For Highway Racers:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Keep your registration and license clean.</strong> Many racing charges get stacked with suspended license or expired tags — avoid easy losses.</li>
    <li><strong>If stopped, stay respectful.</strong> Record the interaction if you can. Don’t argue or flee. Ask if you're being detained and state your rights clearly.</li>
    <li><strong>Vehicle impound?</strong> Ask for a tow release hearing immediately. You may be able to recover your vehicle before large fees hit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Important Reminders:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Remain silent.</strong> This is your power. Use it.</li>
    <li><strong>Ask for a lawyer immediately.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Document everything you can safely.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Never sign anything you don’t understand.</strong></li>
  </ul>
